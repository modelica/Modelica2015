<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>MODELICA Modeling Tutorial -&nbsp;Learn using Modelica with a tool of your choice</p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong>&nbsp;Dr. Dirk Zimmer, DLR</p>
<p><strong>Abstract<em>:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;This tutorial offers a basic hands-on introduction in modeling and simulation with Modelica. The tutorial is aimed at people with little or no practical experience in using Modelica. All participants have the opportunity to create a model of a controlled inverse pendulum in a graphical way. This model will demonstrate the strength of Modelica by combining different fields of engineering. To this end, mechanical, electrical, and control components are simulated in a single environment.</em></p>
<p><em>Please bring your own laptop! For the tutorial, you can use any Modelica tool that supports graphical modeling. For participants with no tool at hand, demo versions will be provided by tool vendors. According to the current planning, at least Dymola, OpenModelica, SimulationX, and SystemModeler will be provided.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition to the basic modeling task, background knowledge is presented that explains six key elements of the Modelica language:</em></p>
<p><em>• Equation-based modeling</em></p>
<p><em>• Non-causal system description</em></p>
<p><em>• Physical connectors and signals</em></p>
<p><em>• Object-orientation</em></p>
<p><em>• Graphical modeling</em></p>
<p><em>• Modelica Standard Library</em></p>
<p><em>As final step, tasks like the modeling of hybrid systems will be carried out by introducing dry-friction and backlash to the gear model, and adapting the controller.</em></p>
<p><em>About the tutor:</em></p>

<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>Optimal control and state estimation with Modelica and Optimica</p>
<p><strong>Presenters:</strong>&nbsp;Johan Åkesson, Christian Andersson, Toivo Henningsson, Per-Ola Larsson, Stéphane Velut, Modelon AB</p>
<p><strong>Abstract<em>:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>This tutorial demonstrates how Modelica and Optimica are used to formulate and solve optimization problems targeting control of industrial processes.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A key focus of the tutorial is usability of numerical algorithms when solving dynamic optimization problems arising in control applications. While numerical algorithms and software for non-linear dynamic optimization has been available for many years, industrial application is often hindered by challenges in achieving robust convergence for large-scale models. This tutorial demonstrates how new tool capabilities support users in isolating and resolving convergence problems. In particular, means to isolate problematic equations that contribute to non-convergence in Modelica models are presented. In addition novel heuristics for problem scaling is used to further improve convergence robustness. Participants are offered hands on experiences with effective tools for achieving convergence in industrial optimization problems.</em></p>
<p><em>Attention is given to methods to achieve real-time performance in non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) and Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) applications. New tool capabilities supporting warm-start of optimization algorithms significantly reduce solve time when solving a sequence of optimization problems, as is done in NMPC and MHE.</em></p>
<p><em>The tutorial offers on open source tool track which is based on JModelica.org and one commercial tool track which is based on the OPTIMICA Compiler Toolkit. The latter track also offers hands on experiences with optimization of industrial power generation systems.</em></p>
<p><em>The tutorial is supported by Modelon’s experts in optimization technology and optimization of power generation systems.<br /><br /></em></p>

<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>Working with MapleSim 2015</p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong>&nbsp;Chad Schmitke, MapleSim Development, Maplesoft</p>
<p><strong>Abstract<em>:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;MapleSim allows users to create and document their own symbolic and numeric analyses of Modelica models in a rich problem-solving environment. &nbsp;Although the basics of creating and simulating models within MapleSim will be covered, the focus of the tutorial will be on the connection between MapleSim and Maple, and the unique analysis opportunities it provides. Hands-on exercises in a variety of application areas will demonstrate how to work with Modelica models within this environment. &nbsp;We will also look at how the resulting analysis can be easily wrapped in a custom UI (sliders, interactive plots, etc.) and deployed on the web.</em></p>
<p><em>Example areas will include: extracting, interrogating, and solving kinematic and dynamic equations; creating, manipulating and discretizing PDEs; automatically converting Maple equations into Modelica components; creating parametric, linearized models and finding their Eigenvalues; using MapleSim’s programming interface to perform parameter sweeps and optimizations.<br /><br /></em></p>

<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>Git and GitHub for Modelica users and developers</p>
<p><strong>Presenters:</strong>&nbsp;Dietmar Winkler, Mike Tiller</p>
<p><strong>Abstract<em>:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>This tutorial provides an introduction to Git, the distributed version control system, and GitHub. It is divided in two main parts:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;1. Getting started with Git:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Why Version Control</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Light introduction to what Git actually does</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;- First commands to create repositories, change files, commit changes &nbsp; <br />2. Getting started with GitHub:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Create a fork of an existing project</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Real bug fixing of example issues by use of</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * branching</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * committing changes with correct commit messages</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * creating pull requests</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * getting pull-requests accepted <br />3. More advanced git commands explained (if time allows)</em></p>
<p><em>Prerequisites:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;* a laptop with a modern browser (Firefox or Chrome are recommended)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;* for part 1. you can additionally install git locally on your machine (http://git-scm.com/download/) but participating using only your web browser is fine too.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;* for part 2. a free GitHub account is needed. It helps if you set up this in advance by signing up for GitHub under: https://github.com/</em></p>
<p><em>Background:</em></p>
<p><em>In the past, open-source projects have been migrating away from centralized version control systems like CVS and Subversion to decentralized ones. &nbsp;At the moment, the most popular of these is Git.</em></p>
<p><em>Two years ago, the Modelica Association started making all its Modelica libraries available via GitHub as Git mirrors</em></p>
<p><em>(https://github.com/modelica) and placing all user libraries in one central place (https://github.com/modelica-3rdparty). Subsequently library repositories increasingly evolved from being mirrors to being real Git repository with development taking place on GitHub.</em></p>
<p><em>Git's decentralized development makes it easy for developers to modify, fix and contribute to the libraries of others. In addition, GitHub provides great infrastructure to support communication, forking and issue tracking. For open source projects, GitHub's functionality is completely free.<br /><br /></em></p>

<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>Dependability Analysis for Modelica Models</p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong>&nbsp;Marc Bouissou, EDF; Lena Buffoni, Linköping University</p>
<p><strong>Abstract<em>:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;In the development of modern large-scale systems, the verification of important non-functional requirements such as dependability and safety is often postponed to the last stages of the development process with a high risk of having to revise even basic design choices and with a consequent increase in both completion time and development costs. Including dependability information in models from the early stages would ensure that the system design takes into consideration these important factors. The tutorial will introduce the basic principles of dependability analysis for beginners, with a focus on Fault Analysis Trees. The goal is to show how to model failures in a system using FTA, to introduce key algorithms for FTA analysis and to introduce the tool-chain for generating FTAs automatically from Modelica models using the Figaro extension for Modelica. Figaro is a reliability modelling language developed by EDF (Électricité de France) to be a general representation formalism.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The tutorial will be hands on, so bring a laptop with a Windows environment. Participants will be shown through a series of exercises how to add dependability information to Modelica models with the use of the Figaro library, how to work with a Figaro knowledge base to define dependability rules for a class of Modelica systems and how to generate fault trees from Modelica models extended with dependability properties. Emphasis will be made on using inheritance and OO principles to maximise reusability and efficiency when adding dependability information to models.&nbsp;</em></p>
