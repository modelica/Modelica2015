<h2>Proceedings</h2>
<p>The 11th International Modelica Conference,
which takes place at Palais des Congrès de
Versailles, is the main event for the Modelica
community. Users, library developers, tool vendors, and
language designers gather to share their knowledge
and learn about the latest scientific and industrial
progress related to Modelica and FMI (Functional
Mockup Interface).</p>

<p>The fundamental idea behind Modelica is to allow
storing modeling knowhow in a high-level formally
defined format, i.e., to collect information which
you otherwise would find in engineering books only
accessible by humans. By allowing convenient reuse
of this knowhow by definition of component model
libraries, enormous saving in man-hours for setting up
simulation studies is achieved. Furthermore, by proper
validation of such model libraries, much more reliable
conclusions can be made from simulation studies
leading to better products and user experience.
These considerations lead to the equation-based
object-oriented formalism of Modelica.</p>

<p>Since the start of the collaborative design work for
Modelica in 1996, Modelica has matured from an idea
among a small number of dedicated enthusiasts to a
widely accepted standard language for the modeling
and simulation of cyber-physical systems. In addition,
the standardization of the language by the non-profit
organization Modelica Association enables Modelica
models to be portable between a growing number
of tools. Modelica is now used in many industries
including automotive, energy and process, aerospace,
and industrial equipment. Modelica is the language of
choice for model-based systems engineering.</p>

<p>The FMI standard has been added to the project
portfolio of the Modelica Association. FMI provides
a complementary standard that enables deployment
of pre-compiled high quality models originating
from different model formats to a larger number of
engineers working with system design and verification.</p>

<p>The format of the conference is somewhat changed
compared to previous years. We moved the vendor
sessions to the first day of the conference to have two
days of purely scientific presentations. Starting the
tutorials one hour earlier allowed us to allocate
more time and have room for 15 vendors to present
their offers compared to 6 at the previous conference.</p>

<p>The program is available in an event app for smartphones,
tablets, and PCs. It enables searching for
papers with abstracts, authors, and conference rooms.
It also allows setting up your own schedule by selecting
your favorite presentations.</p>

<p>Taking a walk in the Garden of Versailles is suggested
on Tuesday evening. We have allocated a break of more
than one hour after the scientific program before the
conference dinner is served at the Palais des Congrès
de Versailles. This means that you have time to see the
Apollo Fountain.</p>

<p>Conference highlights:
<ul>
<li>2 Keynote speeches</li>
<li>83 papers in 4 parallel tracks</li>
<li>18 posters</li>
<li>7 tutorials</li>
<li>5 libraries submitted for the Modelica Library Award</li>
<li>15 vendor sessions presenting the latest Modelica and FMI tools</li>
<li>A fully booked exhibition area featuring 20 exhibitors</li>
<li>Electronic proceedings including all papers and some associated Modelica libraries and models</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we want to acknowledge the support we
received from the conference board and program
committee. Special thanks to our colleagues at this
year’s organizers, Dassault Systèmes and Linköping
University, and Amelie Rönngård from Altitude
Meetings. The support from the conference sponsors is
gratefully acknowledged. Last but not least, thanks to
all authors, keynote speakers, and presenters for their
contributions to this conference.</p>

<p>
We wish all participants an enjoyable and inspiring
conference.
