The Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC) is an international non-profit organization with many organizational members, supporting the long-term development and usage of OpenModelica â€“ an open-source Modelica-based modeling, simulation, optimization, and cyber-physical system development environment. OSMC provides OpenModelica both to industrial end-users and to industrial OEM companies for inclusion in products, to universities and institutes for research and teaching, and also consulting services related to OpenModelica and Modelica. We invite companies, universities, engineers, researchers, and students, or any interested developer to participate in the project and cooperate around OpenModelica, tools, and applications.
