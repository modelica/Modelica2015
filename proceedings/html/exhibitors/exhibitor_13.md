The energy system simulation specialist XRG Simulation GmbH will present his portfolio of commercial and free Modelica libraries (HumanComfort, HVAC, Hydronics, ClaRa) and Modelica related tools (e.g., ModelOpt, Canvas). Visitors will have the chance to get insight into the libraries' content and typical applications. Furthermore, exciting developments like the Modelica 3D Convection Model for coarse grid CFD simulations will be presented. The 3D Convection Model will be part of the next HumanComfort release and can be used for detailed flow simulations in air-conditioned spaces (e.g., in buildings and vehicles).

Another development is a comprehensive Modelica library for hybrid municipal energy systems which aims to design energy storages and converters for networks with high renewable power input. XRG Simulation's new open source libraries enable complex energy supply simulations covering the whole process chain from detailed power plant simulation up to complete municipal energy system optimization.
