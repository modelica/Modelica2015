ESI-Group is a pioneer and world-leading provider in Virtual Prototyping that takes into account the physics of materials. ESI boasts a unique know-how in Virtual Product Engineering, based on an integrated suite of coherent, industry-oriented applications. Based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Fined Element Analysis (FEA) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, ESI has developed an extensive suite of integrated, industry-oriented applications: to realistically simulate a product’s behavior during testing; to fine-tune manufacturing processes in accordance with desired product performance; and to evaluate the environment’s impact on performance.  ESI’s solutions fit into a single collaborative and open environment for End-to-End Virtual Prototyping thus reducing, even eliminating, the need for physical prototypes during product development.

At the exhibition session, ESI will demonstrate some of its standard product and the new Modelica-based system modeling software product line called EXI-Xplorer with emphasis on its integration with the some of the ESI Virtual Prototyping solutions using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and/or Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The visitors will also have the opportunity to immerse themselves into ESI’s IC.IDO Virtual Reality system and experience a virtual world driven by Modelica simulations.
