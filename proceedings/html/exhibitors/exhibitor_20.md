IGNITE, Ricardo Software’s physics-based simulation package focused on complete vehicle performance and fuel economy simulation. With an extensive collection of Modelica-based commercial libraries, IGNITE offers a complete range of powertrain configurations and options to be considered and integrated. Providing a comprehensive set of vehicle system “building blocks” allows users to quickly and accurately model complete conventional, hybrid-electric, full electric and novel vehicle architectures. Our faster than real-time simulation and native design/optimization tools enable users to make key decisions in the most cost-effective and robust manner.
