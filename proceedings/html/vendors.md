</li><li><strong>Xogeny &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /></strong>
<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>Transforming Modelica/FMI Models into Web Applications with XenGen</p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong>&nbsp;Michael Tiller</p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Modelica and FMI have created unprecedented opportunities for creating high-quality models. &nbsp;But to truly demonstrate the value of these models, it is important that they can be used by as many people as possible.&nbsp;<br /><br />For this reason, Xogeny has created the Xenarius Generator (or XenGen, for short) to provide an easy way to transform models into web-based engineering applications. &nbsp;The goal of the XenGen tool is to provide model developers with an effortless way to reach and serve new users. &nbsp;XenGen applications don't require any software to be installed because they are deployed as web applications that can run in any standard web browser (both on desktop and mobile devices). &nbsp;In addition to the generated user interface, the XenGen platform also provides back-end services for both data management and simulation.<br /><br />Users of Modelica and FMI are already investing in model development. &nbsp;XenGen will allow you to greatly expand the return on that investment by getting those models into the hands of as many users as possible.<br /></li></ul>
