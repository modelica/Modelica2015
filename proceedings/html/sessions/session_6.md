<b>Title:</b> A systems engineering perspective for Modelica and the heritage of synchronous language<br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_24.html">Dr. Albert Benveniste</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>
In the first part of my talk I shall develop a vision
of the central role of Modelica in systems engineering.
The Modrio project has recently developed a Requirements
profile for Modelica and progresses have recently been
made regarding the link between Modelica and safety
analyses. I shall discuss how far, I think, one could go in
these directions. I shall also draw directions toward using
Modelica for system-wide monitoring and diagnosis. All
of this calls for a rigorous understanding of Modelica, its
execution semantics: paying attention to this will constitute
the second part of my presentation. I shall describe the
background from synchronous languages by emphasizing
how sound compilation schemes can be formally derived
and how some of the above mentioned uses in system
engineering were performed with synchronous languages.
I shall conclude by indicating how these techniques can be
adapted to derive structural analyses for multi-mode DAE
systems. Nonstandard analysis will be used to help for this.
