<b>Title:</b> Designing Cyber-Physical Systems: A Tale of Two Worlds Coming Together<br />

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>Cyber-Physical Systems have been the focus of
many research and public forum initiatives in the world
since the early 2000s. The concept of CPS involves the
tight integration and co-design of physical (for example,
mechanical, electrical, biological and chemical), systems
with analysis, monitoring and control implemented on a
computing system. As such it has important intersections
with other fields of great interests such as Internet of
Things, Hybrid Systems, Swarm Systems and Systems of
Systems. One of the main challenges has been to develop
solid foundations for design and manufacturing including
formal methods and requirement capture.
</p>
<p>
I will review the major directions of research and industrial
relevance of CPS with particular attention to design
methodologies and requirement capture with considerations
about approaches to CPS simulation and analysis and their
limitations.
