The 11th International Modelica Conference will be held at the Palais des Congrès de Versailles, France on September 21-23, 2015. It is organized by Dassault Systèmes and Linköping University in cooperation with Modelica Association.

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the Functional Mockup Interface. The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. In addition to traditional paper presentations and poster sessions, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as vendor presentations, and an exhibition. The previous Modelica conference in 2014 was visited by 400 participants from all over the world, and we expect even more participants at this conference.

More information is contained in the conference [flyer/poster](files/Modelica.Conference.2015.Flyer-Poster.pdf). The first page is intended to be printed in larger format such as A3 as a poster. Please post at your bulletin board or by the coffee machine to promote and remind about the conference.

# Conference Venue

The conference will take place at the [Palais des Congrès de Versailles](http://www.viparis.com/viparisFront/do/centre/palais-des-congres-versailles/en/Accueil) located 17 km west of Paris and about 300 m from the Palace of Versailles.

# Scope of the Conference

[Modelica](https://modelica.org) is a freely available, equation-based, object-oriented language for convenient and efficient modeling of complex, multi-domain cyber-physical systems described by ordinary differential, difference and algebraic equations. The companion Modelica Standard Library has been utilized in demanding industrial applications, including full vehicle dynamics, power systems, robotics, hardware-in-the-loop simulations and embedded control systems.

The [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](http://www.fmi-standard.org/) is a freely available standard for the tool-independent exchange of models and for co-simulation. It is supported by many Modelica and non-Modelica tools and is the key to utilize Modelica models in non-Modelica environments.

The Modelica conference will bring together people using Modelica and/or FMI for modeling, simulation, and control applications, Modelica language designers, Modelica and/or FMI tool vendors and Modelica library developers. It provides Modelica users the opportunity to stay informed about the latest language, library, and tool developments, and to get in touch with people working on similar modeling problems. The conference will cover topics such as the following:

* Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with Modelica
* Free and commercial Modelica libraries (mechanics, electrical, hydraulics, thermal, fluid, media, chemical, building, automotive, aircraft, ...)
* Automotive applications
* Thermodynamic and energy systems applications
* Mechatronics and robotics applications
* Other industrial applications, such as electric drives, power systems, aerospace, etc.
* Real-time and hardware-in-the-loop simulation
* Simulation and code generation for embedded control systems
* Simulation acceleration by use of many CPU/GPU cores
* Applications of Modelica for optimization and optimal control
* Modelica modeling, simulation and design tools
* Symbolic algorithms and numerical methods for model transformation and simulation
* Discrete modeling techniques - FEM, CFD, DEM (Discrete Element Method), ...
* New features of Modelica language and FMI
* Modelica in other application areas (mathematical programming, databases etc.)
* Modelica for teaching and education
* FMI in Modelica and non-Modelica applications and tools

In addition, the conference will include:

* Modelica tutorials/workshops for different levels of modeling experience
* Modelica Award for the 2 best free Modelica libraries (500 + 250 Euro)
* Vendors' presentations of commercial and free Modelica tools
* Vendors' exhibition
